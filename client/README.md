# PostIt

PostIt is my first MERN mini project I've created *by myself* using the knowledge I've gained from learning nodejs express, reactjs, mongoose and redux. There is an authentication system and a way for users to create posts, like and dislike posts and even delete posts. For the styling I went with tailwindcss because like that way it is easy to implement into a project and the fact that you only have to add a few
styles to make things look good.
## Installation

The installation process is quite easy follow these steps:

```js
cd /post-it/client
npm install && npm start
```

```js
cd /post-it/server
npm install && npm start
```
*Please make sure you have the latest version of node installed*
*Remember to create a mongodb cluster called `postit` before using the project also*

*If you have installed and used this mini project and want updates or have any issues contact in on Instagram: @coreycodes*

Thank you :)
